Expo Jewelry project:
The page has 5 buttons:
1. necklaces
2. bracelets
3. rings
By selecting either of these three, the costumer is shown the options in that category.
Each product has a name, price, and image, as well as an option to add to the cart.
4. shopping cart: 
If the costumer didn't add any products to his cart, then nothing will show up. If he did,
the items he chose will show up (in an event that the costumer selected the same product 
more than once, it will show up in the cart as many times as selected).
Each item in the cart has an option to be removed from the cart.
5. total:
If the costumer didn't add any products to his cart, then nothing will show up. If he did,
the total cost of all the products he chose will show up on the screen when pressing this
button.
